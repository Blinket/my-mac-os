# Night blue theme for Textual IRC
I use my own custom theme for [Textual app](https://www.codeux.com).

I usually split Textual and Telegram client in full screen side by side. And Telegram has a pretty awesome Night blue theme I use and like. I changed Textual theme to match the theme of it.

Here is how it looks side by side:

## Install
To install the theme, download the Night Blue folder attached [here](Night%20blue).

Then go to Textual app. Go to preferences and in Styles click on `Browse Styles` here:

Put the downloaded folder inside the folder. You can read [this](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Styles.kb) for more information.
